JS code is non-blocking
So callbacks and events are used to change the order
of code execution

Event loop starts automatically.

The callback functions does not stop
later parts of the code. They does work
side by side.

There is default separation method to separate
different requests.

writeFileSync() sends response before executing itself
writeFile execute first and blocks rest of the code
